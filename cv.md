## About Me
I am 20 years old, I am a student of UNN. I am learning to be a software engineer.
I have some experience working on a study project in a team with subsequent performance in the competition of projects.
In addition to the basic theoretical knowledge obtained at the university, I really want to master the practical skills of developing.
To achieve this goal, I chose the profession as a frontend developer. I am ready to spend much time and desire for this.
